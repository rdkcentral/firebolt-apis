## 1. Overview

This document is both a style guide *and* a template for Firebolt Requirements 
Specifications. 

The Overview section is a non-normative or informative introduction to the 
contents and subject matter of the document. This is included to introduce the 
reader to the overall problem, solution, and scope. No formal requirements will 
be included here, as it will often be skipped by readers that are already 
familiar with the document. 

Overviews can be as long or short as appropriate for the subject matter, and 
should have a target audience ranging from technical product managers to 
engineering teams that may be testing, implementing, or integrating with the 
functionality described in the document. 

The overview must contain the following towards the end: 

Requirements documents are written using the [IETF Best Common Practice 
14](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) and should include the 
following summary in the Overview section: 

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL 
NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**NOT 
RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be 
interpreted as described in [BCP 
14](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and 
only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

**NOTE**: This is a simple table of contents. It should include links to all 
headers in the document, except for the top-level header (i.e. `# Title`). It 
is recommended to use a Markdown plugin to generate this based on headers 
ranging from level two to level six. Delete this note from your actual spec :) 
## 3. Specification Style Requirements

Firebolt uses method templates in order to code-generate consistent APIs. For 
example, methods with the `"property"` tag only need to have the `getter` 
editorially defined. The Firebolt OpenRPC tools will auto-generate the `setter` 
and `subscriber` as OpenRPC methods with matching types. Additionally, the 
Firebolt OpenRPC tools wil then code-generate the getter, setter, and 
subscriber as APIs in various languages using templates. 

This enables both consistent APIs (all properties have a recongnizable pattern) 
and consistent SDK implementation, which reduces the code that needs to be 
tested. 
### 3.1. General Style Requirements

All headers **MUST** be numbered, and have the parent header as the prefix, 
separated with '.' 

Module and method names, as well as constants **MUST** be in monospace font, 
e.g. the `Foo` module **MUST** have a `bar` method that returns `true`. Specs 
should use JavaScript notation for any code examples if the spec is not 
targeting another specific language binding, e.g. a spec about Event listeners 
in C++ would use C++ syntax. 

String constants and values **MUST** be wrapped in quotes for clarity, e.g. 
`"Hello World"`. 
### 3.2. Firebolt Style Requirements

All Firebolt APIs exposed for building Firebolt Apps **MUST** be exposed as 
JSON-RPC methods on a WebSocket accessible to the device, typically running 
locally. 

Parameters and return values for all APIs **MUST** be described using 
JSON-Schema schemas. 

Methods **MUST** be grouped into “modules” or “packages” of functionality. 

The JSON-RPC method name of any method **MUST** follow the template: 
```
<module>.<method>

``` 

e.g. 
```
lifecycle.ready

``` 

JSON-RPC method names are case sensitive. 

Methods **MUST** have at least one capability used, managed, or provided by the 
method. 

Methods **MAY** require the use of more than one capability, but this means 
that the app must have permission to all of them. In order to enable App 
permissions to be evaluated in an isolated layer, separate from the method 
implementation itself, a Firebolt method **MUST NOT** be specified to add or 
remove fields based on the caller's permissions. 

The words used in method and parameter names **SHOULD** be used as consistently 
as possible across the Firebolt API surface. See the [Firebolt API 
Glossary](./glossary.md) for words that Firebolt uses and how they are used. 
### 3.3. Firebolt Method Templates

Methods **SHOULD** consider using the existing Firebolt method tags, in order 
to have a level of consistency across APIs. 

If a Firebolt method is specified such that it requires a non-existant 
template, then a new Requirements Specification **MUST** be written and 
referenced by the specification that inspired it. Method templates **MUST** be 
designed with re-use in mind. 
## 4. Example Section

A section describes group of closely related features. Many specifications have 
only one section, however, more complicated specifications may have many. The 
first paragraph of a section is typically a non-normative introduction to that 
section, and therefor does not contain any formal requirements. 
### 4.1. Example Feature

Each feature under a section will have it's own heading. Non-normative 
introductions to features are not typically needed, as the reader is ready to 
get into requirements at this point. It is recommended that all Feature 
headings under each Section contain only sentences or short paragraphs with 
formal requirements, e.g. **MUST**, **SHOULD**, **MAY**, **MUST** NOT, **SHOULD 
NOT**, etc. These sentences should be separated by blank lines for readability, 
e.g.: 

This requirement **MUST** be satisifed. 

This requirement **SHOULD** be satisfied. 

This requirement **MUST** be satisfied. The requirement **MUST** be satisifed 
in this particular way.
