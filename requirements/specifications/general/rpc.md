## 1. Overview
This document outlines the requirements for remote procedure call (RPC) APIs surfaced by a Firebolt implementation to Firebolt Apps.

This document does not cover the scope of the Firebolt SDK vs the App itself, and the term "Firebolt App" is meant to denote a fully built App, including the Firebolt SDK.

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**NOT RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## 3. Protocol
Firebolt implmentations **MUST** support RPC using the [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) protocol.

The RPC interface of every Firebolt method **MUST** be defined via an [OpenRPC document](https://spec.open-rpc.org).

RPC method definitions **SHOULD** use the [Firebolt OpenRPC](https://github.com/rdkcentral/firebolt-openrpc/) Extensions to enable language-specific design patterns to be applied to similar APIs.

Firebolt implementations **MAY** support other RPC protocols in addition to JSON-RPC 2.0, as long as a compatible transport layer is provided so that apps do not have to be rewritten.

Firebolt implementations **MUST** support all aspects of the JSON-RPC specification.

Firebolt implementations **MUST** send only one response for each request.

Firebolt implementations **MUST** treat all named OpenRPC fields, i.e. fields with a `"name"` attribute, as case-senstitive values, including, but not limited to methods and params.

Firebolt implementations **MUST** return a `-32600` error (Invalid Request) if a method having no result definition is requested with an `id` value.

### 3.1. OpenRPC Documents
Since both the App and the Firebolt Implementation expose APIs, there **MUST** be a separate OpenRPC definition for each.

The Firebolt Implementation OpenRPC Document:
```
firebolt-open-rpc.json
```

The Firebolt App OpenRPC Document:

```
firebolt-app-open-rpc.json
```

#### 3.1.1. OpenRPC Ids
The Firebolt Implementation OpenRPC Document **MUST** have the `$id` set to:

```
"$schema": "https://meta.open-rpc.org/",
"$id": "https://rdkcentral.github.io/firebolt/openrpc/platform"
```

An HTTP `GET` on `https://rdkcentral.github.io/firebolt/openrpc/platform` **MUST** return the latest production version of the Firebolt Implementation Open RPC Definition.

The Firebolt App OpenRpc Document **MUST** have the `$id` set to:

```
"$schema": "https://meta.open-rpc.org/",
"$id": "https://rdkcentral.github.io/firebolt/openrpc/app"
```

An HTTP `GET` on `https://rdkcentral.github.io/firebolt/openrpc/app` **MUST** return the latest production version of the Firebolt App Open RPC Definition.

#### 3.1.2. Duplex Linking
Since a platform OpenRPC definition has a corresponding application defintion, it **MUST** be denoted by an OpenRPC `x-client-api` extension property in the `info` section.

Similarly, the application OpenRPC definition **MUST** reference the platform definition in the `x-client-api` property.

Firebolt Platform OpenRPC:

```json
{
    "$id": "https://rdkcentral.github.io/firebolt/openrpc/platform",
    "info": {
        "title": "Firebolt",
        "x-client-api": "https://rdkcentral.github.io/firebolt/openrpc/app"
    }
}
```

Firebolt Application OpenRPC:

```json
{
    "$id": "https://rdkcentral.github.io/firebolt/openrpc/app",
    "info": {
        "title": "Firebolt App",
        "x-client-api": "https://rdkcentral.github.io/firebolt/openrpc/platform"
    }
}
```

### 3.2. Firebolt Modules
In order to support groups of methods, i.e. "interfaces," Firebolt uses dot-notation in the method name, so a method named `Module.foo` would create a `foo()` method inside of a module called `Module`.

For standard JSON-RPC interactions, the module name is simply part of the method name.

Some Firebolt-specific OpenRPC extensions use the module name to refer to an entire group of methods within the module.

Firebolt OpenRPC allows zero or more module names, e.g. `foo` and `Module.foo`, and `Module.Submodule.foo` are all valid method names.

### 3.3. Asynchronous Events
Asynchronous events, aka "notifications," **MUST** be handled by leveraging the common "duplex" pattern where both the Firebolt App & the Firebolt Implementation act as a JSON-RPC Server *and* a JSON-RPC client.

To register for an event, e.g "sunrise", the Firebolt App would call an RPC method on the Firebolt Implementation called `Sky.onSunrise` with the `listen` parameter set to `true`:

App -> Firebolt

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "method": "Sky.onSunrise",
    "params": {
        "listen": true
    }
}
```

This `onSunrise` call **MUST** only have one response: either an empty success result, or an error describing why the event registration was not successful.

2.0 success

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "result": null
}
```

2.0 failure

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "error": {
        "code": 111,
        "message": "failed"
    }
}
```

If a Firebolt App has registered for an event, e.g. "sunrise," then the Firebolt Implementation **SHOULD** send any occurences of the "sunrise" event to the app via a JSON-RPC notification request:

Firebolt -> App

```json
{
    "method": "Sky.sunrise",
    "params": {}
}
```

If a Firebolt App registers (or unregisters) for an event, e.g. "sunrise," more than once, then the Firebolt Implementation **SHOULD** treat the request as a success if the initial request was successful. The Firebolt Implementation **MUST** send only one notification to the app per occurences of the "sunrise" event regardless of how many times it registered.

A single unregistration for an event **MUST** result in the notifications for that event being turned off for that app, regardless of how many times the app had registered.

#### 3.3.1. Notifier OpenRPC Extension
The Platform event registration API **MUST** have an `x-notifier` extension property on the `event` tag with the full name of the Application RPC notification method:

```json
{
    "info": {
        "title": "Firebolt Platform"
    },
    "methods": [
        {
            "name": "Sky.onSunrise",
            "tags": [
                {
                    "name": "event",
                    "x-notifier": "Sky.sunrise"
                }
            ],
            "params": [
                {
                    "name": "listen",
                    "required": true,
                    "schema": {
                        "type": "boolean"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

The Application OpenRPC definition for the notification **MUST** have an `x-event` extension property on the `notifier` tag with the full name of the Platform RPC registeration method, e.g.:

```json
{
    "info": {
        "title": "Firebolt Application"
    },
    "methods": [
        {
            "name": "Sky.sunrise",
            "tags": [
                {
                    "name": "notifier",
                    "x-event": "Sky.onSunrise"
                }
            ],
            "params": [
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

The notifer method **MUST** have no `"result"` defined, since no response is expected or allowed.

If an OpenRPC method tagged as a "notifier" does not have a `x-event` attribute on the tag, then the value **MUST** be generated by the Firebolt OpenRPC tooling to match the pattern: `<Module>.on<Method>`, e.g. a method named `Sky.sunrise` would have the `x-event` value set to `Sky.onSunrise`.

If an OpenRPC method in the Application tagged as "notifier" does not have a method matching the `x-event` extension in the Platform OpenRPC, then a method **MUST** be generated by the Firebolt OpenRPC tooling that with a matching `x-notifier` property on the "event" tag and a matching name.

### 3.4. Provider Interfaces
Provider Interfaces allow a Firebolt App to "provide" a Firebolt Capability back to the Firebolt Implementation, in the form of an interface dictated by Firebolt and implemented by the app.

Provider Interfaces **MUST** be handled by leveraging the common "duplex" pattern where both the Firebolt App & the Firebolt Implementation act as a JSON-RPC Server *and* a JSON-RPC client.

For this example, the `"xrn:firebolt:capability:sky:sun"` interface consists of (Written in TypeScript for brevity):

```typescript
interface Sun {
    function rise(): Promise<void>;
    function set(): Promise<void>;
}
```

To register as a provider for a capability, e.g. `"xrn:firebolt:capability:sky:sun"`, the Firebolt App would call an RPC method on the Firebolt Implementation to enable the interface to be called on the application by the platform.

To register for this Provider Interface, the Firebolt App would call the RPC method, e.g.:

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "method": "Sky.provideSun",
    "params": {
        "enabled": true
    }
}
```

If a Firebolt App has registered as a capability provider, e.g. "xrn:firebolt:capability:sky:sun", then the Firebolt Implementation **SHOULD** call the appropriate methods via the app's JSON-RPC server as neeeded, e.g.:

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "method": "Sun.rise",
    "params": []
}
```

The app **MUST** respond either either a result or an error.

#### 3.4.1. Interface OpenRPC Extension
The Platform provider registration API **MUST** have a `registration` tag and an `x-interface` string parameter denoting the name of the interface from the Application OpenRPC that this registration API is enabling.

```json
{
    "info": {
        "title": "Firebolt Platform"
    },
    "methods": [
        {
            "name": "Sky.provideSun",
            "tags": [
				{
					"name": "registration",
                    "x-interface": "Sun"
				}
            ],
            "params": [
                {
                    "name": "enabled",
                    "required": true,
                    "schema": {
                        "type": "boolean"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

The Application OpenRPC definition for the interface **MUST** have one or more methods with the provided `x-interface` value as the module name, e.g.:

```json
{
    "info": {
        "title": "Firebolt Application"
    },
    "methods": [
        {
            "name": "Sun.rise",
            "tags": [
                {
                    "name": "capabilities",
                    "x-provides": "xrn:firebolt:capability:sky:sun",
                    "x-allow-focus": true
                }
            ],
            "params": [],
        },
        {
            "name": "Sun.set",
            "tags": [
                {
                    "name": "capabilities",
                    "x-provides": "xrn:firebolt:capability:sky:sun",
                    "x-allow-focus": true
                }
            ],
            "params": []
        }
    ]
}
```

#### 3.4.2. Client Provider Example
Using the [Lifecycle](../lifecycle/index.md) `Application` and `Activatable` interfaces as an example:

```typescript
import { Lifecycle } from '@firebolt-js/sdk'

class myApp implements Lifecycle.IApplication {
  async function create(params: CreateParameters) {}
  async function suspend() {}
  async function resume() {}
  async function destroy() {}
}

const app = new myApp()

await Lifecycle.provideApplication(app)
```

The Firebolt Implementation OpenRPC would include:

```json
{
    "info": {
        "title": "Firebolt Platform"
    },
    "methods": [
        {
            "name": "Lifecycle.provideApplication",
            "tags": [
				{
					"name": "registration",
                    "x-interface": "Application"
				}
            ],
            "params": [
                {
                    "name": "enabled",
                    "required": true,
                    "schema": {
                        "type": "boolean"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

The Firebolt App OpenRPC would include:

```json
{
    "info": {
        "title": "Firebolt App"
    },
    "methods": [
        {
            "name": "Application.create",
            "tags": [
                {
                    "name": "capabilities",
                    "x-provides": "xrn:firebolt:capability:lifecycle:application"
                }
            ],
            "params": [
                {
                    "name": "params",
                    "schema": {
                        "$ref": "#/components/schemas/CreateParameters"
                    }
                }
            ],
            "result": {
                "name": "default",
                "schema": {
                    "type": "null"
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "Application.suspend",
            "tags": [
                {
                    "name": "capabilities",
                    "x-provides": "xrn:firebolt:capability:lifecycle:application"
                }
            ],
            "params": [],
            "result": {
                "name": "default",
                "schema": {
                    "type": "null"
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "Application.resume",
            "tags": [
                {
                    "name": "capabilities",
                    "x-provides": "xrn:firebolt:capability:lifecycle:application"
                }
            ],
            "params": [],
            "result": {
                "name": "default",
                "schema": {
                    "type": "null"
                }
            }

                {
                    "name": "capabilities",

                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## 4. Transport
The RPC Protocol **MUST** be handled over a WebSocket.

### 4.1. API Version
The Firebolt API Version *and* protocol **MUST** be passsed as part of the Sec-WebSocket-Protocol header:

```http
Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: firebolt.v2.0.0, jsonrpc
```
    
## 5. Firebolt SDK

### 5.1. Additive changes
If the Firebolt API makes an additive change, e.g.:

- a new parameter on a method or notification
- a new attribute on an object

Then apps that are targeting the minor version *before* that change **MUST NOT** start receiving the new additional value, so that they don't suddenly have different behavior or break.

This **MAY** be solved at the SDK-level via RPC parsing, or at the API gateway level, via version targeting, or both.
