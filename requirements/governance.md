# Requirements Governance

This document outlines the governance model for the Firebolt&reg; Open-Source 
Project, including the structure of an Advisory Board and Working Groups, as 
well as the process used to codify Requirements Specifications and 
Architectural Decision Records. 
## 1. Overview

The Firebolt Open-Source Project is governed by an Advisory Board that creates 
and delegates work to Working Groups, which then create proposals for 
Requirements Specifications and Architectural Decision Records.

## 3. Goals

The goal of the Firebolt Open-Source Project is to provide a 
Distributor-configurable set of integration APIs and functional requirements 
for those APIs so that Apps can integrate with the APIs once and run their app 
on every Firebolt platform (regardless of distributor) consistently. 

Specifically, Firebolt provides: 
 - Write Apps once, run on all Firebolt distributors
 - Discovery and launching of Apps
 - Detection of, and access control for, Firebolt APIs and features
 - Discovery of app content and metrics once discovered
 - Platform integration APIs, (e.g. captions, media info, etc.)
 - Device and account management
 - Integration APIs for broader eco-system integrations

(e.g. user experience, advertising, voice, etc.) 

While enabling Distributors to: 
 - Provide differentiating Discovery and Settings experiences
 - Configure Firebolt features to meet their business needs
 - Configure Firebolt user privacy & opt-in settings
 - Decide which set of optional Firebolt features to support
 - Negotiate access to features and APIs with each app

## 4. Governance

The Firebolt Open-Source Project is governed by an Advisory Board. The purpose 
of the Advisory Board is to ensure that each major, minor, and patch version of 
the Firebolt Requirements is aligned with the goals of the Firebolt Open-Source 
Project. 

The Firebolt Requirements are the collection of all Requirements Specifications 
and all Architectural Decision Records that are ratified by the Advisory Board 
(and contained in this repository). 
### 4.1. Scope

This document describes the governance model for the following components: 
 - Firebolt RPC APIs & SDKs
 - Firebolt Media Pipeline (aka Rialto)
 - Firebolt API Reference Implementation (Ripple)

### 4.2. Firebolt Version

A Firebolt Version is a snapshot of the Firebolt Requirements that has been 
ratified as an official release of the requirements. Note that the requirements 
are decoupled from any implementation of those requirements, and iterations to 
the requirements will occur with input from any teams implementing them. 

Firebolt Versions **MUST** follow Semantic Versioning. 
### 4.3. Advisory Board

The Advisory Board oversees all aspects of Firebolt Requirements Governance. 

Advisory Board decisions should aim to be unanimous whenever possible, but in 
cases of deadlock, may be decided by simple majority. 

The Advisory Board is responsible for: 
 - Prioritization of Working Groups needed
 - Creation of balanced Working Groups with relevant subject matter experts
 - Solicitation of peer review by SMEs that are not from the working group
 - Ratification of requirements into the official Firebolt Requirements
 - Determination of when to tag a new minor version release of the Firebolt Requirements
 - Determination of when to tag a new major version release of the Firebolt Requirements
 - Determination of when a sanctioned fork is warranted

### 4.4. Advisory Board Members

The Firebolt Advisory Board is currently being formed and will be published 
soon. 

Contact the `rdkcentral/firebolt-apis` maintainer, [Jeremy 
LaCivita](https://github.com/jlacivita), to submit proposals to the Advisory 
Board. 
### 4.5. Working Group

Working Groups build consensus on requirements for Firebolt features or 
architectural solutions. They should ideally be three to five individuals 
spanning technical and product experts. Further recommendations on working 
group composition are left to the Advisory Board. 

As new features are prioritized, Working Groups should be formed to gather and 
document requirements for those features. Working groups may be self-forming or 
selected by the Advisory Board, but all working groups must have their 
membership reviewed and approved by the board to ensure that they are well 
balanced. 

The Advisory Board **MAY** appoint a Working Group Chair or instruct the 
Working Group to select a chair amongst themselves. 

The Working Group Chair is responsible for driving consensus and reporting back 
to the Advisory Board 
### 4.6. Requirements Specification

A Requirements Specification includes all details necessary for multiple, 
disassociated teams to build a consistent implementation of a feature, 
including API signatures, validation, and functionality, as well as functional 
and behavioral requirements of the feature that are not directly exposed by an 
API. 

Requirements and APIs may be targeted towards traditional 3rd party apps, as 
well as more foundational 1st party apps. 

The level of detail in an acceptable Requirements Specification should be such 
that any App should run consistently on any implementation of the feature that 
is based on the Specification. 

Requirements Specifications are written using the [IETF Best Common Practice 
14](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) and should include the 
following at the end of the Overview: 

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL 
NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**NOT 
RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be 
interpreted as described in [BCP 
14](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and 
only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here. 

Requirements Specification move through several [stages](#48-approval-stages) 
from being a draft, to being an official versioned requirements specification. 
### 4.7. Architectural Decision Record

An Architectural Decision Record includes all details necessary to ensure that 
Firebolt Requirements are fulfilled with an architecturally sound design. This 
is often used in cases where listing out explicit requirements, e.g. 
performance or operational requirements, is not possible or realistic, e.g. 
Requiring use of a well-known open source component to fulfill some aspect of 
the platform, or requiring adherence to a high level modular breakdown of 
concerns to keep platform maintenance manageable. 

Since ADRs included in the Firebolt Requirements **MUST** be adhered to, not 
every architectural decision made in order to fulfill the Firebolt Requirements 
needs to have a formal ADR in the Firebolt Requirements repository. It is up to 
the Advisory Board which ADRs warrent a formal inclusion in the Firebolt 
Requirements. 

ADRs move through the same [stages](#48-approval-stages) as Requirements 
Specifications. 
### 4.8. Approval Stages

Requirements specifications and ADRs are written by working groups and go 
through several stages of approval before becoming official requirements 
documents. 

![Approval Track](./images/governance/approval-track.png) 
#### 4.8.1. Draft

This is any first draft of a requirements specification submitted by an 
individual or individuals to a Working Group. 

Artifacts: 
 - A markdown document, ready to be presented to the Working Group


Note that a Draft **MUST** not be committed to any public location, e.g. the 
Requirements Repository, because it has not yet been reviewed by the Working 
Group and could mistakenly contain sensative, private information related to a 
specific Firebolt distributor. 
#### 4.8.2. Working Draft

A version of the requirements specification that is approved by the Working 
Group for feedback and review by individuals not on the Working Group. 
Individuals are selected for review at the discretion of the Working Group. 
Working drafts may or may not satisfy all requirements of the feature and 
should not be used for derivative works. 

Artifacts: 
 - Markdown specification in a named feature branch of the Requirements Repository
 - Working Group members identified
 - Working Group progress is being tracked via GitHub project in the Requirements Repository

#### 4.8.3. Candidate Specification

A version of the requirements specification that is approved by the Working 
Group for proof-of-concept implementations and peer-review by the larger 
Community. Candidate Specifications have been through significant review by the 
Working Group and are ready for feedback from the larger community. 

Once this is published to the peer group for review, theyâ€™ll have two weeks to 
add their comments, make amendments requests, etc. 

Artifacts: 
 - Markdown specification in a named feature branch of the Requirements Repository
 - Domain experts for peer-review identified and notified
 - Repeat process for any C.S. Drafts that are formalized into the C.S. (see below)
 - JSON-Schema API changes outlined by the document are in the OpenRPC schemas

#### 4.8.4. Candidate Specification Draft

A fork of the current Candidate Specification that has changes requested, but 
not yet approved, by the Working Group. 

Artifacts: 
 - A Pull Request into the feature branch containing in-progress changes
 - Previous Candidate Specification does not include changes until approved by W.G.

#### 4.8.5. Proposed Specification

A version of the requirements specification that is considered, by the Working 
Group, to be the final Candidate Specification, and has been submitted to the 
Advisory Board for final approval. This version may be used for experimental 
implementations and final peer-review by the larger community. 


Artifacts: 
 - Markdown specification merged into the #proposed branch of the Requirements Repository
 - A Pull Request into the #next branch of Requirements Repository
 - JSON-Schema API changes outlined by the document are in the OpenRPC schemas
 - Unit tests for any API changes

#### 4.8.6. Specification

An official versioned stage of the requirements specification that is done and 
will not change until a future version is created. This version may be used for 
official production implementations. 

Artifacts: 
 - Markdown specification merged into the #main branch of the Requirements Repository
 - Spec Review notes and green light from implementation teams of all member organizations with a vested interest in the specification
 - Status tracking link for any Open Source implementations of the spec, if appropriate

### 4.9. Requirements Repository

A public GitHub repository used to manage the progress of a requirements 
specification. Requirements Specification **MUST** live in their own 
repository, and not along side of the code that is implementing them. 

The Requirements Repository **MUST** be located at: 

[https://github.com/rdkcentral/firebolt-apis](https://github.com/rdkcentral/firebolt-apis) 
 
### 4.10. Requirements Repository Branching

The Requirements Repository **MUST** have the following branches: 
| Branch   | Purpose                                                                                  |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| main     | For officially approved specifications that have been released under a version.          |
| next     | For all approved specifications, even those that have not been released under a version. |
| proposed | An experimental branch containing all proposed specifications.                           |

Working Drafts and Candidate Specification Drafts **MUST** be housed in a named 
feature branch in the Requirements Repository (see below). 

Branches are merged based on the approval process: 

![Branching](./images/governance/branching.png) 

### 4.11. Sanctioned Forks

From time to time an organization with access to the Requirements Repository 
may want to spearhead a new feature without going through the formal approval 
process. 

In this case the member may submit a request to the Approval Board for a 
sanctioned fork inside the Requirements Repository, so that research and 
development can be done on the feature. 

The Approval Board **MAY** grant or deny the request for a sanctioned fork. 

After the R&D is complete, the forking organization **MUST** submit the 
resulting requirements to the formal process and work to have them approved. 

The organization requesting the fork **MUST** be willing to migrate to the 
approved APIs, which may be different than the API in the fork. 

The Advisory Board, and selected Working Group, **SHOULD** be willing to avoid 
unnecessary changes to make migration as easy as possible, without sacrificing 
the integrity of the Firebolt Open-Source Projectâ€™s goals. 

### 4.12. Release Versions

The Advisory Board has ownership of when to do major, minor, and patch releases 
of the Firebolt Requirements. 

Releases **MUST** follow Semantic Versioning. 

Approved changes are all housed in the next branch until the Advisory Board 
decides that the next branch warrants an officially released version of the 
requirements. 

If a feature that requires a major version increment, i.e. a breaking change, 
is proposed, the Advisory Board may decide to keep it unapproved so that any 
features requiring a minor version change can be pushed through the process. 
Management of this is the responsibility of the Advisory Board.
