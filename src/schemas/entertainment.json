If the entitlement is known to\nexpire at a certain time (e.g., a rental), the app should also provide the\n`entitledExpires` property. If the entitlement is not expired, the UI will use\nthe `entitled` property to display watchable assets to the user, adjust how\nassets are presented to the user, and how intents into the app are generated.\nFor example, the the Aggregated Experience could render a \"Watch\" button for an\nentitled asset versus a \"Subscribe\" button for an non-entitled asset.\n\nThe app should set the `offeringType` to define how the content may be\nauthorized. The UI will use this to adjust how content is presented to the user.\n\nA single WayToWatch cannot represent streamable assets available via multiple\npurchase paths. If, for example, an asset has both Buy, Rent and Subscription\navailability, the three different entitlement paths MUST be represented as\nmultiple WayToWatch objects.\n\n`price` should be populated for WayToWatch objects with `buy` or `rent`\n`offeringType`.
